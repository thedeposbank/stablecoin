Depos is a stablecoin technology, the main idea behind is to collateralize stablecoin supply
with fixed income instruments which produce interest rate and at the same time provide
liquidity for holders to easily and in a trustless way exchange stablecoin to native token, say EOS.
Fixed income instruments are of on-chain basis. This is possible due to [dBonds](https://www.dbonds.org)
protocol of debt tokenization. Total supply of stablecoins 1:1 equals to the total value of the
total collateral.

As a first step, fiat bonds issued by well known brands and corporates
(say, Deutche Bank AG) are tokenized to produce high-quality and quite stable in value on-chain collateral.
But the debt itself is the easiest thing to tokenize and even more, after a debt is tokenized, this
obligation can be traded on the secondary market providing to the lender more liquidity, as it is now 
in fiat world. 

So, as a future step, we see the straight on-chain obligations issuance nominated in our stablecoin
under suitable jurisdiction to skip all expensive intermidiaries. At the same time we will move
all management to the community of steakholders shifting to DAO.

Since this stablecoin approach differs a lot from existing onces, we need to say a few words on how
it is profitable. You may think of that as of a bank. 
On the one side, there is a major part of assets that produce predictable revenue on capital 
(digital bonds) and a minor part of volatile but liquid assets (ex. EOS), wich is similar to cash 
that bank stores for withdrawals. On the other side, there is a major part of stablecoins in circulation 
and a minor part of stablecoins forming the bank capital. All profits and losses accumulated within the bank 
capital, creating revenue of loss for the steakholders.
